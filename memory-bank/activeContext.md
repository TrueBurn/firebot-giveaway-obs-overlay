# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on architectural improvements, specifically implementing the IOptions pattern for all app settings and integrating Serilog for structured logging.

## Recent Changes

### Twitch Chat Integration (April 14, 2025)
- Added direct Twitch chat integration using TwitchLib
- Implemented command handling for giveaway management
- Created a configuration UI for Twitch settings
- Added support for follower-only giveaways
- Created comprehensive documentation and unit tests

### Winner Overlay Improvements (April 14, 2025)
- Changed the winner overlay background from semi-transparent (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)`) to solid black (`rgb(0, 0, 0)`) to prevent distracting content from showing through
- Removed the trophy emojis that were displayed on both sides of the winner name for a cleaner look

## Open Questions/Issues

- What level of logging detail is appropriate for different components of the application?
- Should we consider implementing a more robust validation mechanism for settings?

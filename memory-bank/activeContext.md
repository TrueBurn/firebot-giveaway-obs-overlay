# Active Context

## Current Focus

### [2025-07-26] Comprehensive Timer Enhancement Implementation
- Successfully implemented hours support for countdown timer functionality
- Added configurable timer enable/disable feature for flexible giveaway types
- Enhanced user interface with complete timer control state management
- Updated configuration system to handle three-parameter time settings and timer state
- Validated all implementations with successful build and compilation

### Memory Bank Initialization (2025-01-26)
- Establishing complete memory bank structure according to LLM agent memory bank instructions
- Creating standardized files for project context tracking
- Updating CLAUDE.md to reflect full memory bank integration

## Recent Changes

### [2025-07-26] Complete Timer System Enhancement
- Added CountdownHours configuration to appsettings.json with default value 0
- Added CountdownTimerEnabled configuration to appsettings.json with default value true
- Enhanced GiveAwayHelpers class to support three-parameter time configuration and timer state management
- Updated Program.cs configuration loading to include hours parameter and timer enabled state
- Modified GiveAway.razor timer logic and display formatting for hours support and conditional timer visibility

- Added disabled state styling for timer inputs and reset button when timer is disabled
- Implemented automatic timer state management with stop/reset functionality based on toggle state
- Successfully validated all implementations with dotnet build (no compilation errors)

### 2025-01-26 - Memory Bank Setup
- Created productContext.md with comprehensive project overview
- Initializing activeContext.md for session tracking
- Preparing systemPatterns.md for architectural patterns
- Setting up decisionLog.md for architectural decisions
- Creating progress.md for task tracking

### April 14, 2025 - Winner Overlay Improvements
- Changed winner overlay background from semi-transparent to solid black
- Removed trophy emojis from winner display for cleaner appearance
- Improved visual consistency and reduced visual clutter

## Open Questions/Issues

### Configuration Management
- Should configuration options be expanded beyond current appsettings.json?
- Would benefit from runtime configuration updates without restart?

### Performance Optimization
- File monitoring efficiency with large numbers of entries
- Animation performance on lower-end streaming setups

### Feature Requests
- Multiple simultaneous giveaway support
- Integration with streaming platforms beyond file-based approach
- Enhanced customization options for colors and themes

## Next Priorities

1. Complete memory bank file structure initialization
2. Update CLAUDE.md with full memory bank integration details
3. Consider implementation of future enhancement ideas from roadmap

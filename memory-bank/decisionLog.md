# Decision Log

## [2025-04-14 10:00:00] - Twitch Chat Integration Implementation

**Decision:** Implement direct Twitch chat integration using TwitchLib instead of relying on external tools.

**Rationale:** 
- Provides more control over the giveaway process
- Eliminates the need for users to set up additional software
- Allows for real-time interaction with chat participants
- Enables follower-only giveaways and other advanced features

**Implications:**
- Requires users to provide Twitch credentials
- Adds complexity to the application
- Requires additional testing and documentation
- May need regular updates to maintain compatibility with Twitch API changes

## [2025-04-14 15:30:00] - Winner Overlay Background Change

**Decision:** Change the winner overlay background from semi-transparent (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)`) to solid black (`rgb(0, 0, 0)`).

**Rationale:**
- Prevents distracting content from showing through
- Improves readability of winner announcements
- Creates a more professional appearance

**Implications:**
- Less visual connection to the stream content behind the overlay
- More prominent interruption of the stream visuals
- Cleaner overall appearance

## [2025-04-14 15:45:00] - Remove Trophy Emojis from Winner Display

**Decision:** Remove the trophy emojis that were displayed on both sides of the winner name.

**Rationale:**
- Creates a cleaner, more professional look
- Reduces visual clutter
- Allows for better focus on the winner's name

**Implications:**
- Less festive appearance
- More minimalist design
- Improved readability

[2025-04-14 22:22:51] - Initial creation of decisionLog.md based on recent modifications

## [2025-04-14 22:54:15] - IOptions Pattern Implementation with Dynamic Updates

**Decision:** Implement the IOptions pattern for all app settings with support for dynamic updates using IOptionsMonitor/IOptionsSnapshot instead of standard IOptions.

**Rationale:**
- Provides type safety and dependency injection for configuration
- Enables centralized configuration management
- Maintains the ability to update settings at runtime with immediate effect
- Improves testability through proper dependency injection

**Implications:**
- Requires refactoring of static helper classes
- Needs a custom settings service to manage updates
- May impact existing components that rely on static configuration
- Requires updates to UI components to use the settings service

## [2025-04-14 22:54:30] - Serilog Integration for Structured Logging

**Decision:** Integrate Serilog for structured logging throughout the application.

**Rationale:**
- Provides consistent logging format across the application
- Enables filtering by log levels
- Supports multiple output sinks (console, file)
- Adds contextual information to log entries

**Implications:**
- Requires updating all logging calls throughout the codebase
- Adds new dependencies to the project
- Needs configuration in appsettings.json
- May slightly increase application startup time

## [2025-04-14 23:27:00] - Test Updates for IOptionsMonitor

**Decision:** Update all test files to use IOptionsMonitor instead of IOptions to match service implementations.

**Rationale:**
- Ensures consistency between production and test code
- Prevents test failures due to interface mismatches
- Allows proper testing of change notification features

**Implications:**
- Required updates to mock setup in test files
- Needed to implement OnChange callback simulation in tests
- Improved test coverage for dynamic configuration scenarios

## [2025-04-14 23:55:41] - UI Thread Marshaling for Settings Change Events

**Decision:** Modify all Blazor components that handle settings change events to use `InvokeAsync()` when calling `StateHasChanged()`.

**Rationale:**
- Prevents "The current thread is not associated with the Dispatcher" exceptions
- Properly marshals UI updates from background threads to the UI thread
- Maintains the dynamic configuration update capability while ensuring thread safety
- Follows Blazor best practices for component state updates

**Implications:**
- Required updates to `Setup.razor` and `TwitchSetup.razor` components
- Establishes a pattern for handling all background events that trigger UI updates
- May need similar updates in future components that subscribe to background events
- Improves application stability when settings are changed externally

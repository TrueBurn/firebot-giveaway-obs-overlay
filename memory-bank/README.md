# Memory Bank

This directory contains files that help maintain context about the project across sessions. The Memory Bank stores important information about:

- Project structure and architecture
- Key components and their relationships
- Important design decisions
- Completed tasks and modifications
- Pending tasks and future plans

This helps ensure continuity and consistency when working on the project over time.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of the following files:

1. **productContext.md** - High-level project description, goals, features, and overall architecture
2. **activeContext.md** - Current focus of work, recent changes, and open questions/issues
3. **systemPatterns.md** - Architectural patterns and design decisions used in the project
4. **decisionLog.md** - Record of significant architectural decisions, their rationale, and implications
5. **progress.md** - Tracking of completed tasks, in-progress work, and future plans

## Usage Guidelines

- When making significant changes to the project, update the relevant memory bank files
- Always include timestamps with your updates in the format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`
- For major architectural decisions, add entries to decisionLog.md
- Keep activeContext.md updated with the current focus of work
- Record completed tasks and future plans in progress.md
